    <h1>Extensions</h1>

    <p>The functionality of jMock can be extended by optional plug-in
    libraries.</p>

    <h2>jMock Legacy</h2>

    <p>The <a href="mocking-classes.html">jMock Legacy Extension</a> provides
    an Imposteriser that can imposterise classes as well as interfaces. This
    is useful when working with legacy code to tease apart dependencies
    between tightly coupled classes. The ClassImposteriser creates mock
    instances without calling the constructor of the mocked class. So classes
    with constructors that have arguments or call overideable methods of the
    object can be safely mocked. However, the ClassImposteriser cannot create
    mocks of final classes or mock final methods.</p>

    <h2>jMock Scripting</h2>

    <p>The <a href="scripting.html">jMock Scripting Extension</a> lets you
    define custom actions inline in the expectation, as <a
    href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell</a> scripts.</p>

    <p>Included in the jMock distribution</p>

    <h2>MockInject</h2>

    <p><a href="https://mockinject.dev.java.net/">MockInject</a> uses AspectJ
    to inject mock objects at constructor or method calls. The injection
    points can be defined with simple EDSL. You don't kneed to know AOP or
    AspectJ to use this extension.</p>

    <h2>JDave</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.jdave.org">JDave</a> is a test framework that
    integrates with jMock. Of particular note is its <a
    href="http://www.jdave.org/documentation.html#mocking">unfinalizer</a>, an
    instrumentation agent that strips final modifiers from classes as they are
    loaded into the JVM. Combined with the ClassImposteriser in the jMock
    Legacy extension (see above), this lets you mock final classes and
    methods.</p>
