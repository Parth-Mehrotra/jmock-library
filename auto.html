    <h1>Automagically Creating Mocks, States &amp; Sequences</h1>

    <p>If you define fields to hold mock objects, states or sequences , jMock
    can automagically instantiate them, reducing boilerplate code.</p>

    <p>To automagically create a mock object, annotate the field with
    <code>@Mock</code>. JMock will initialise the field to hold a new mock
    object with the same name as the field before the test runs.</p>

    <p>For example, the following declarations create two mock objects named
    "cheddar" and "jarlsberg". </p>

    <pre class="Java Source">@Mock Cheese cheddar;
@Mock Cheese jarlsberg;</pre>

    <p>To automagically create <a href="states.html">State</a> and <a
    href="sequences.html">Sequence</a> objects, annotate the fields with
    <code>@Auto</code>. Again, jMock will initialise the field with a new
    object named after the field before the test runs:</p>

    <pre class="Java Source">@Auto States pen;
@Auto Sequence events;</pre>
  </body>
