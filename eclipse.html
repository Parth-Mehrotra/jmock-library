<h1>Mocking Classes in Eclipse Plug-in Tests</h1>

<p>by Ulli Hafner.</p>

<p>Mocking classes in Eclipse plug-ins requires some extra work (mocking
interfaces works out of the box). Typically, an Eclipse application consists
of several source plug-ins. The unit tests of these plug-ins are also stored
in different plug-ins. E.g., if the main code of an application is stored in
<code>com.foo.core</code> then the tests are stored in the plug-in
<code>com.foo.core.tests</code>.</p>

<p>Within Eclipse you have the possibility to start your tests as JUnit test
or plug-in tests. For Junit tests Eclipse simply calls the JUnit runner,
tests your class and reports the results. You can use jMock as a library on
your classpath without any additional configuration.</p>

<p>However, when running tests as plug-in tests Eclipse starts the target
Eclipse platform, deploys your tests in this platform and starts these tests.
Eclipse loads each plug-in from the <a
href="http://www.eclipsezone.com/articles/eclipse-vms/">OSGI classloader
mechanism</a>. Each plug-in will be loaded by an individual classloader. In
this case you cannot create mocks for classes that are part of another
plug-in out of the box. Since the classes to mock are loaded by a different
classloader jMock cannot access them (actually cglib does not see these
classes).</p>

<p>In order to mock classes in other plug-ins you need to use the Eclipse
buddy declarations in your plug-ins. Basically, you need to add in the
MANIFEST of the plug-ins that contain the actual classes the following
statement: Eclipse-BuddyPolicy: registered. This statement instructs the
Eclipse class loader to let other plug-ins access these classes. In your
jMock test plug-in you need to add in the MANIFEST file the counterpart
statement "<code>Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: com.foo.plugin1,
com.foo.plugin2</code>". Now you can mock classes of the plug-ins
<code>com.foo.plugin1</code> and <code>com.foo.plugin2</code> in your test
cases.</p>
