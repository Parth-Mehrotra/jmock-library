        <p>By default, jMock is not thread safe and so its mock objects should not
    be called from multiple threads. However, people frequently do use it this
    way. They may want to use mock objects when stress-testing the
    synchronisation of an object they've written and tested using the
    deterministic executor. Or they may want to test a class that they are
    implementing with a third-party library that calls into their code from
    multiple threads. To use jMock with multiple threads, you have to plug a
    different ThreadingPolicy into the Mockery.</p>
        <p>A ThreadingPolicy is an object that the Mockery uses to synchronise
    access to its state. A ThreadingPolicy wraps a decorator around every Mock
    Object before it is imposterised and so intercepts all mocked calls
    entering the Mockery and all results and exceptions that it returns. The
    default ThreadingPolicy complains if the mock objects are used by more
    than one thread. But if you want to test multithreaded code you can plug a
    Synchroniser into the Mockery instead.</p>
        <p>You use the Synchroniser like this:</p>
        <pre class="Java Source">Mockery mockery = new JUnit4Mockery() {{
    setThreadingPolicy(new Synchroniser());
}};</pre>
        <p>Now any mock objects created by the Mockery can be safely invoked from
    multiple threads. It's that easy. The Synchroniser has other features that
    help test multithreaded code, that are described elsewhere in the <a href="cookbook.html">cookbook</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">1</sup>.</p>
        <h2>Error Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>Testing multithreaded code is made difficult because failures do not
    get thrown on the test thread. The test framework cannot easily trap those
    exceptions and fail the test with a helpful diagnostic message. Often
    tests fail with a timeout, which has no message explaining why the timeout
    was exceeded. Or, an assertion on the test thread fails because an error
    that occurred on a background thread left the object under test in an
    invalid state, but information about the root cause of the failure is
    lost. JMock has a few mechanisms to help with this. </p>
        <p>JMock captures the first expectation failure that is thrown from a mock
    object. If the error is swallowed, either by a background thread or by a
    try/catch block in the foreground thread, the test will continue running
    and the mockery will throw the error when the test asserts that all
    expected calls have been made. This is usually done automatically at the
    end of the test.</p>
        <p>The Synchroniser's wait methods also fail fast and rethrow expectation
    violations that occur on background threads. A test can wait for the
    system to enter an expected state but if it does not do so because the
    system violated an expectation, the wait will immediately abort and throw
    the error that originally reported the violated expectation.</p>
        <p>The Mockery records a trace of all the invocations that any mock object
    has received during the test and includes the trace recorded so far when
    it throws an expectation error.</p>
        <p>The combination of failing fast, reporting the root cause of failure,
    and reporting the sequence of calls that led to the failure makes
    diagnosis much easier than a bare "test timed out" message.</p>
