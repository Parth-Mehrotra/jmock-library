        <h1>Testing Multithreaded Code</h1>
        <p>A question that is frequently asked on the <a href="http://www.jmock.org">jMock</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">1</sup> users' <a href="http://www.jmock.org/mailing-lists.html">mailing list</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">2</sup> is "how do
    I use mock objects to test a class that spawns new threads"? The problem
    is that jMock appears to ignore unexpected calls if they are made on a
    different thread than that which runs the test itself. The mock object
    actually does throw an <code>AssertionFailedError</code> when it receives
    an unexpected call, but the error terminates the concurrent thread instead
    of the test runner's thread.</p>
        <p>Here's an example. We have a guard and an alarm. When the guard notices
    a burglar, he should ring the alarm once only.</p>
        <pre class="Source Java">public interface Alarm {
    void ring();
}</pre>
        <pre class="Source Java">@Test
public void ringsTheAlarmOnceWhenNoticesABurglar() {
    final Alarm alarm = context.mock(Alarm.class);
    Guard guard = new Guard(alarm);
    
    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        oneOf (alarm).ring();
    }});
    
    guard.notice(new Burglar());
}</pre>
        <p>Here's an implementation of Guard that should fail the test:</p>
        <pre class="Source Java">public class Guard {
    private Alarm alarm;
    
    public Guard( Alarm alarm ) {
        this.alarm = alarm;
    }
    
    public void notice(Burglar burglar) {
        startRingingTheAlarm();
    }
    
    private void startRingingTheAlarm() {
        Runnable ringAlarmTask = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
                    alarm.ring();
                }
            }
        };
        
        Thread ringAlarmThread = new Thread(ringAlarmTask);
        ringAlarmThread.start();
    }
}</pre>
        <p>Although that implementation is incorrect, the test will appear to pass
    because the mock Alarm will throw an AssertionFailedError on the
    ringAlarmThread, not the test runner's thread.</p>
        <p>The root of the problem is trying to use mock objects for integration
    testing. Mock objects are used for unit testing in the traditional sense:
    to test units in isolation from other parts of the system. Threads,
    however, by their very nature, require some kind of integration test.
    Concurrency and synchronisation are system-wide concerns and code that
    creates threads must make use of operating system facilities to do so.</p>
        <p>A solution is to separate the object that needs to run tasks from the
    details of how tasks are run and define an interface between the two. We
    can test the object that needs to run tasks by mocking the task runner,
    and test the implementation of the task runner in integration tests.
    Java's standard concurrency library defines just such an interface: <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html">java.util.concurrent.Executor</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">3</sup>.
    In our example, we can pass an Executor to the Guard and change the Guard
    so that it asks the executor to run tasks instead of explicitly creating
    new threads.</p>
        <p>Our test then looks like:</p>
        <pre class="Source Java">@Test
public void ringsTheAlarmOnceWhenNoticesABurglar() {
    final Alarm alarm = context.mock(Alarm.class);
    Executor executor = ... // What goes here?
    Guard guard = new Guard(alarm, executor);
    
    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        oneOf (alarm).ring();
    }});
    
    guard.notice(new Burglar());
}</pre>
        <p>But how should we implement the Executor for our test? If we use an
    Executor that creates a new thread we'll be back where we started and our
    tests will still, wrongly, appear to pass. We need to run the task in the
    same thread as the test runner. To do this we could mock the Executor
    interface and use a <a href="custom-actions.html">custom action</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">4</sup> to
    call back to the task's run method. However, that does not correctly
    reflect how a background task would behave: the task executes before the
    notify method has returned, instead of afterwards. This difference is
    significant when a task modifies the state of an object.</p>
        <p>Instead we need an object that implements the Executor interface and
    lets us explicitly run the tasks after the <code>notice(Burglar)</code>
    method has returned. JMock provides a class that does just this: the
    <code>DeterministicExecutor</code>. Using it, our test looks like:</p>
        <pre class="Java Source">@Test
public void ringsTheAlarmOnceWhenNoticesABurglar() {
    final Alarm alarm = context.mock(Alarm.class);
    DeterministicExecutor executor = new DeterministicExecutor();
    Guard guard = new Guard(alarm, executor);
    
    guard.notice(new Burglar());
    
    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        oneOf (alarm).ring();
    }});
    
    executor.runUntilIdle();    
}</pre>
        <p>And the implementation of the Guard that uses an Executor looks like
    this:</p>
        <pre class="Source Java">public class Guard {
    private Alarm alarm;
    private Executor executor;
    
    public Guard(Alarm alarm, Executor executor) {
        this.alarm = alarm;
        this.executor = executor;
    }
    
    public void notice(Burglar burglar) {
        startRingingTheAlarm();
    }
    
    private void startRingingTheAlarm() {
        Runnable ringAlarmTask = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
                    alarm.ring();
                }
            }
        };
        executor.execute(ringAlarmTask);
    }
}</pre>
        <p>It's still not correct, but at least our tests can detect the error
    now!</p>
        <p>The test tells the executor to run until idle, which runs pending tasks
    until there are no more to execute. This allows tasks to launch new tasks.
    If that happened forever, the executor would, of course, enter an infinite
    loop. Therefore the DeterministicExecutor also let's a test run only the
    pending tasks to support applications that spawn an infinite sequence of
    tasks.</p>
        <p>Beyond easy testing, the advantage of pulling out the Executor from the
    Guard is that the Guard does not hide its concurrency policy within its
    implementation. Concurrency is a system-wide concern and should be
    controlled outside the Guard object. By passing an appropriate Executor to
    its constructor, the application can easily adapt the Guard to the
    application's threading policy without having to change the Guard's
    implementation.</p>
        <p>However, this technique tests the only functional behaviour of the
    objects. It does not test the synchronisation. You'll also need
    integration tests that put truly concurrent code under load, using the <a href="threading-blitzer.html">Blitzer</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">5</sup> for example, and try to detect
    synchronisation errors. By separating the concerns of functionality and
    synchronisation you will know that any errors in your load tests are
    caused by synchronisation problems, not bugs in the functional
    behaviour.</p>
