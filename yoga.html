        <h1>jMock: Yoga for Your Unit Tests</h1>
        <p class="Note Information">The examples in this article use the jMock 1 API.
The ideas are just as applicable to jMock 2 (or EasyMock or any other mock
object framework).</p>
        <p>Brittle tests are a common "gotcha" of test driven development. A brittle
unit test will stop passing when you make unrelated changes to your
application code. A test suite that contains a lot of brittle tests will slow
down development and inhibit refactoring. Thests become brittle when they
overspecify the behaviour of the unit being tested. You can keep your tests
flexible by following a simple rule of thumb: <span class="RuleOfThumb">specify exactly what you want to happen <em>and no
more</em></span>. This article describes how various features of jMock can
help you strike the right balance between an accurate specification of a
unit's required behaviour and a flexible test that allows easy evolution of
the code base.</p>
        <h2>Stubs and Expectations</h2>
        <p>jMock distinguishes between stubbed and expected methods. A stubbed method
call can occur during a test run, but if it does not occur the test still
passes. An expected method call, on the other hand, <em>must</em> occur
during a test run; if it does not occur, the test fails when it verifies the
mock. When setting up your mocks you must choose whether to stub or expect
each invocation. In general, we have found that tests are kept flexible when
we follow this rule of thumb: <span class="RuleOfThumb">stub queries and
expect commands</span>, where a query is a method with no side effects that
does nothing but query the state of an object and a command is a method with
side effects that may, or may not, return a result. Of course, this rule does
not hold all the time, but it's a useful starting point.</p>
        <p>A stub can be called any number of times. The number of times a method is
expected is defined by the expectation itself. The <code>once()</code>
expectation allows the method to be called once only; subsequent calls will
make the test fail. The <code>atLeastOnce()</code> expectation allows the
method to be called any number of times. The test will only fail if the
method is never called at all. You can define further expectation types if
these are not sufficient for your needs.</p>
        <p>In the following example, the <code>getLoggingLevel</code> is stubbed: it
does not have to be called. The <code>setLoggingLevel</code> must be called
once and once only.</p>
        <div class="Source Java">
<pre>logger.stubs().method("getLoggingLevel").noParams()
    .will(returnValue(Logger.WARNING));
logger.expects(once()).method("setLoggingLevel").with(eq(newLevel));</pre>
</div>
        <h2>Parameter Constraints</h2>
        <p>jMock requires that you specify a <i>constraint</i> on each actual
parameter of a expected invocation, rather than specify just the expected
parameter value. Specifying equality to an expected value is the most common
case, but is too strict for many scenarios. For example, consider a system
that logs errors to a <code>Logger</code> object. To test that an object
correctly detects and logs an error, such as a failed attempt to connect to a
database, you could set up an expectation on a mock logger to check the value
of the message passed to the logger:</p>
        <div class="Source Java">
<pre>String expectedErrorMessage = "unable to connect to ORDERS database: network timeout";

logger.expects(once()).method("error").with(eq(expectedErrorMessage));</pre>
</div>
        <p>This will work in the short term, but will cause problems long term
because it too precisely specifies the expected value of the error message,
including minor details of punctuation and whitespace. If you change that
formatting later, the test will fail even though the code under test still
does what you want it to do. You really only care that the error message
contains the information you want to report to the user (the action
that failed and the cause of the failure) not how that information is
formatted. You can use the constraint functions defined by the
<code>MockObjectTestCase</code> class to specify exactly what you want to
happen:</p>
        <div class="Source Java">
<pre>String action = "connect to ORDERS database";
String cause = "network timeout";

logger.expects(once()).method("error")
    .with( and(stringContains(action),stringContains(cause)) );</pre>
</div>
        <p>The <code>MockObjectTestCase</code> class defines several functions that
can be used to define constraints. There are more constraint types defined in
the <code><a href="java:org.jmock.core.constraint.*">org.jmock.constraint</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">1</sup></code>
package. You can even <a href="custom-constraints.html">define your own
constraints</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">2</sup>.</p>
        <p>Constraints require you to type a little more when writing your tests, and
require you to think more carefully about what behaviour you expect, but the
result is that your tests are easier to read because they clearly express
your intent and more flexible because they don't overspecify expected
behaviour.</p>
        <h2>Invocation Order</h2>
        <p>By default, jMock allows invocations upon a mock object to occur in any
order. Sometimes, however, the order of calls is important, such as when you
are testing an object that fires events or writes data to an output stream.
In such cases you can explicitly specify that a call should occur after one
or more others.</p>
        <div class="Source Java">
<pre>logger.expects(once()).method("setLoggingLevel").with(eq(Logger.WARNING))
    .id("warning level set");
logger.expects(once()).method("warn").with(warningMessage)
    .after("warning level set");
logger.stubs().method("getLoggingLevel").noParams()
    .after("warning level set")
    .will(returnValue(Logger.WARNING));</pre>
</div>
        <p>A rule of thumb to follow when specifying the expected order of method
calls is: <span class="RuleOfThumb">test the ordering of <em>only</em> those
calls you want to occur in order</span>. The example above allows the
<code>warn</code> and <code>getLoggingLevel</code> methods to occur in any
order, as long as they occur after the call to <code>setLoggingLevel</code>.
Thus we can change the order in which our tested object calls
<code>warn</code> and <code>getLoggingLevel</code> without breaking our
tests.</p>
        <p>Specifying the order of calls is orthogonal to whether those calls are
expectations or stubs. So, the example above specifies that the
<code>getLoggingLevel</code> method does not have to be called, but if it is,
it must be called after <code>setLoggingLevel</code>, and that the
<code>warn</code> method must be called and must be called after
<code>setLoggingLevel</code>.</p>
        <h2>Matchers</h2>
        <p>The methods <code>method(</code><var>methodName</var><code>)</code>,
<code>with(</code><var>argument constraints</var><code>)</code> and
<code>after(</code><var>prior call ID</var><code>)</code> are syntactic sugar
that define matching rules that match an incoming invocation to an object
that can mock the behaviour of the invocation and test its expectations. If
jMock does not have a matching rule that you need, or the matching rules
supported by jMock are not accurate enough to keep your tests flexible, you
can extend jMock with matching rules of your own.</p>
        <p>If you need more control over how method names are matched, you can
specify a constraint over names instead of a precise name value. An
invocation will match if the constraint evaluates to <code>true</code> when
applied to the method name. Suppose that you want to stub all calls to the
property getter methods of a mock object by synthesising a default result
based on the type of the property. You could achieve with a constraint that
matches method names that begin with "get" and that have no parameters. (See
<a href="custom-constraints.html">Writing Custom Constraints</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">3</sup> for the
definition of the <code>StringStartsWith</code> class).</p>
        <div class="Source Java">
<pre>...

private DefaultResultStub returnADefaultValue = new DefaultResultStub();

public void testMethod() {
    ...
    mock.stubs().method(startingWith("get")).noParams().will(returnADefaultValue);
    ...
}

private Constraint startingWith( String prefix ) {
    return new StringStartsWith(prefix);
}

...</pre>
</div>
        <p>This example is, however, still brittle. You want the mock to stub all
property getter methods but that is not actually what the test specifies. To
precisely specify the required behaviour you can <a href="custom-matchers.html">write your own matching rule</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">4</sup> that uses the
Java Bean API to test if a method is a property getter.</p>
        <div class="Source Java">
<pre>...

private DefaultResultStub returnADefaultValue = new DefaultResultStub();

public void testMethod() {
    ...
    mock.stubs().match(aBeanPropertyGetter()).will(returnADefaultValue);
    ...
}

private InvocationMatcher aBeanPropertyGetter() {
    return new BeanPropertyGetterMatcher();
}

...</pre>
</div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This article should have given you some idea of why the jMock API is
designed as it is and how that API can help you avoid brittle tests. The most
important rule of thumb we follow to keep our tests flexible is:</p>
        <blockquote>
  <span class="RuleOfThumb">Specify exactly what you want to happen <em>and
  no more</em>.</span></blockquote>
        <p>This guideline is just as applicable when writing unit tests that do not
use mock objects.</p>
