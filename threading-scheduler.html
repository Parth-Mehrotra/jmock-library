    <title>JMock and Threads: Deterministic Scheduling</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>JMock's <a href="000760.html">DetermisticExecutor</a> allows us to more
    easily unit test the behaviour of an object that launches tasks in the
    background. JMock also provides <a
    href="http://www.jmock.org/javadoc/2.5.1/org/jmock/lib/concurrent/DeterministicScheduler.html"
    title="DeterministicScheduler Javadoc">DeterministicScheduler</a> that
    let's us unit test objects that use a <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html">ScheduledExecutorService</a>
    to schedule tasks to run sometime in the future or on repeating schedules.
    The DeterministicScheduler acts as a virtual timeline that the test can
    move forward to represent the passing of time. As its virtual time
    progresses, the DeterministicScheduler executes the tasks that have been
    scheduled.</p>

    <p>You write a test with the deterministic scheduler by invoking the
    object under test to make it schedule tasks, ticking time forward enough
    to make those tasks run, and testing that the tasks have acted as expected
    (either with mock objects or assertions as appropriate).</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre class="Java Source">Door door = context.mock(Door.class);
Alarm alarm = context.mock(Alarm.class);

DeterministicScheduler scheduler = new DeterministicScheduler();

TimeLock lock = new TimeLock(door, alarm);

@Test
public void locksAndUnlocksDoorOnRegularScheduleAndSoundsAlarmBeforeUnlockingDoor() {
    // Configure the behaviour of the lock
    lock.setOpenFor(1000);
    lock.setClosedFor(2000);
    lock.setSoundsAlarmBeforeClosingFor(100);

    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        door.unlock();
    }});
    lock.activate();

    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        alarm.start();
    }});
    scheduler.tick(900);

    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        alarm.stop();
        door.lock();
    }});
    scheduler.tick(100);

    context.checking(new Expectations() {{
        door.unlock();
    }});
    scheduler.tick(2000);
}</pre>

    <p>Because a scheduler service is also an executor, the deterministic
    scheduler allows scheduled tasks to launch background tasks, and
    background tasks to schedule tasks, scheduled tasks to schedule tasks, and
    background tasks to launch background tasks.</p>

    <p>The scheduler does not implement the synchronous methods of the
    SchedulerExecutorService interface. If a test attempts to do a blocking
    wait for a scheduled task to complete, the scheduler will throw an
    UnsupportedSynchronousOperationException.</p>

    <p>You have to he careful if the object under test also queries the
    current time because the deterministic scheduler's time will not be in
    sync with the system clock. You'll have to pass a fake clock to the object
    under test and synchronize the times it returns with the progression of
    time in the deterministic scheduler.</p>
